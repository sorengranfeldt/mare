# Project Description
FIM/MIM R2 MA Rules Extension Framework (hereafter FIM.MARE) is a framework for use with Management Agents in Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2 (FIM2010 R2) or Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 (MIM2016). 

It enables FIM administrators to, declaratively, create advanced flow rules with a vast number of transform functions and even conditions for FIM2010 R2. This framework can be used as a replacement for Synchronization Rules (SR's) or as a supplement to these by using the FIM Synchronization Service to setup the advanced rules.

FIM.MARE reads declared flow rules from an XML configuration file which contains information about the management agent rules available.
